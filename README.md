# Emerald Speedchoice Ex Map Rando

Emerald Ex Speedchoice is a version of emerald with items and pokemon up Gen 8 and changes that make the game nicer to speedrun. The project randomizes all the warps.

<!-- <br>

### *** UPDATE 06/06/2023 *** ###

<br>

V2 of the randomizer is out now! This brings many bug fixes and QoL improvements including the long awaited ability to patch the rom directly. This means no more Web-Based Emulator, you can now patch the rom and play in the emulator of your choice (or on real hardware).<br><br>

Most features from the web version are still available, either from the ingame options or debug menu. <br>
*Multi player badge/tm syncing is still currently only available in the online version V1* <br>

<br>

Please use the 'MAPRANDO' preset when starting to ensure the progression logic is correct <br><br>

## Notes

Most features have been kept similar to the universal warp randomizer such as Mirage tower always present, Regi caves always open, Trick house complete room can be traversed both ways e.t.c Howver there are some differences in this randomizer compared to the universal warp randomizer. Here are some things to be aware of: 

- Game mode: Game should be played with 'Plotless' set to 'Full'. No early surf.
- 'Escape' in menu to avoid any softlocking: 
    - Menu option available anywhere outside the safari zone
    - Indoors / In Caves it works the same as an escape rope (normally last place outdoors)
    - Outside / Underwater it takes you back to Oldale
    - Sometimes, after the screen fades to black, a 'B' input is needed to load the new map.
- Speed Hacks: By default speed hacks are 'Always On'. This runs the game at a faster speed while audio remains normal. 
    - Speed Hacks can be set 'on', 'off' or 'battle only' so only battles are speed up <BR>
    - Normal Emulator Speedup is also available. Both can be toggled with a keybind. <BR>
    - Speed hacks cause some screen tearing, makes fishing frame perfect and cause lag during hall of fame / credits loading. 
- Some warp inclusions/exclusions are different:
    - Added: 
        - Lilycove Art Museum
        - Slateport Dock 
        - Jagged Pass Emblem Door
        - Route 125 Shoal Cave Enterance
        - Ex Exclusive Cave Sootopolis (Right Of Origin)
        - Outside of safari zone
        - Trainer Hill Enterance
    - Removed :
        - Seafloor cavern tide room with centre cave
        - Seafloor cavern exit room
        - Most floors inside cave of origin
        - Warps from drops
- Progression Changes
    - Norman/Wattson completable out-of-order without causing softlock. (Badge order should still be possible in logic) <BR>
    - Player starts with both mach bike and acro bike
    - Entering Normans gym unlocks left of Petalburg (even without doing the catch tutorial)
    - Delivering letter to steven in granite gave unlocks Slateport -> Mauville
    - Waterfall can be obtained outside Sootopolis Gym any time
    - Cave of origin enterance is not blocked
    - Sootopolis gym door always unlocked
    - Magma Emblem always available by talking to old couple on Mt Pyer (even after teams defeated)
    - Dive is never needed in the progression logic (although it might speed things up and is always available from stevens house)
    - Rayquaza can be caught on first visit to Sky Pillar (No need to go back to Sootopolis)
    - Kecleon on brige right of fortree (Route 120) can be removed from left or right 
    - Devon Corp f1, Tunnlers rest house and cable car bottom never blocked
- Misc
    - Darkness is removed from all caves (but not Brawly's gym)
    - Champion battle will not start without talking to him, allowing escape to be used from the menu

- KNOWN GLITCHES 
    - Overworld sprites breaking if certain legendaries like Rayquaza or Hoho are first in the party
    - Sootopolis Wallace dialog invisible if map was loaded from a house on the right
    - Flying/Exiting Slateport Pokecenter when the game in in certain states causes a crash

## MANUALLY CHECKED SEEDS

While every mapping generated should be completable there's always a possiblily of a mistake in the algorithm or underlying data that was not picked up during testing. For that reason a collection of seed files that have been manually tested and completed by a human are made available here:

## Search

As various terms such as pokemon combo map randomizer, combo warp randomizer, crossover map randomizer e.t.c are used interchangeably some people have had issues finding the repository. For this reason I've started added in alternate terms such as map randomiser, multigame map randomizer and Fire Red + Emerald map randomizer to help people find this when using different search terms.
