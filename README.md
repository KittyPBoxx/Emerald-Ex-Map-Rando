## Search

As various terms such as pokemon combo map randomizer, combo warp randomizer, crossover map randomizer e.t.c are used interchangeably some people have had issues finding the repository. For this reason I've started added in alternate terms such as map randomiser, multigame map randomizer and Fire Red + Emerald map randomizer to help people find this when using different search terms.
